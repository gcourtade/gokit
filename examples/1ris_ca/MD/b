GROMACS:      gmx grompp, VERSION 5.0.7
Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Library dir:  /usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/top
Command line:
  grompp -f md.mdp -c gromacs.gro -p gromacs.top -po mdout.out -o run.tpr -maxwarn 1

Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc_grps' by 'compressed-x-grps'

Back Off! I just backed up mdout.out.mdp to ./#mdout.out.mdp.1#

NOTE 1 [file md.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated in Gromacs 5.0 and will be removed
  in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for the
  verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.


NOTE 2 [file md.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (20)


WARNING 1 [file md.mdp]:
  Removing the rotation around the center of mass in a periodic system,
  this can lead to artifacts. Only use this on a single (cluster of)
  molecules. This cluster should not cross periodic boundaries.

Generated 1 of the 1 non-bonded parameter combinations
Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'Macromolecule'
Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 100 K
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 285.00

gcq#366: "I removed all the lambda defaults so that users have to think!" (Berk Hess)
