1tit.pdb downloaded by command:
python conmaps.py --get_pdb 1tit

Examples are provided for different SBM flavours.
---- 
ca=single bead c alpha
cahp=single bead c alpha and hydrophobic contacts
bt=betacourt-thirumalai model
dsb=desolvation barrier potential. Note: MD table file input works for GROMACS V.5.4.3. Changes to be made for later versions. 

Each folder contains MD and PATH directories with sample outputs produced from GROMACS and OPTIM respectively. 

MD:
Table files for the 12-10 LJ potential called table_file.xvg and tablep.xvg are provided with the distribution. These need to be linked to the MD folder.

Tested for GROMACS 2018.3 distribution on a 64-bit Mac OS Mojave. 
 
PATH:
Download OPTIM distribution from:

A simple odata file is generated for performing one L-BFGS optimisation. 

In order to connect multiple local minima and generate disconnectivity graphs,
see PATHSAMPLE manual. 

Ideally, run MD with GROMACS at Tf, cluster structures, add as local minima with ADDMINXYZ into PATHSAMPLE database, the connect with odata.connect. 

Compiled and tested on 64-bit Mac OS Mojave.

---------------------
Examples merely demostrate that the formats of files produced are compatible with OPTIM and GROMACS. Convergence criteria, cutoffs, switching potential cutoff, MD timestep, etc.s are not optimal. Not to be used for production runs.

For example of a single connected pathway with OPTIM for a  production run:

See http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/examples/OPTIM/t3/

See command file in folder to automatically run MD and OPTIM
